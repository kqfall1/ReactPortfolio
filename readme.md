I have levelled up as a developer because I just created a portfolio for myself using React.js, which I have
understand to be a standard tool in the front end web development industry. It was definitely daunting at
first, but creating your own pseudo-HTML elements called components (which are really just JSX functions) isn't
so intimidating anymore. I am still confused on the backend side of front end web development in regards to
Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, but I'm sure I will get the hang of it all eventually.

I am becoming more familiar not only with React, but with creating dark-themed websites. I spent so much time
trying to find a secondary color for my website's font, only to give up and make almost all the text white. One
has less options with dark mode; colors more easily distract and overwhelm. I am now finding that letting white
and the background do the heavy lifting is often the best option.

I also wasted time in this project duplicating CSS logic in nearly every component I created only to abstract
most of them into a global CSS rule located in index.css. DRY really is the golden rule of software. Of course,
I should have figured out the most optimal way of styling my website beforehand. You live and learn!
