I have successfully wired up a functional backend for my personal portfolio 
using the MERN stack. In doing so, I learned lots about RESTful APIs, 
authentication, password management, Express.js and its Request and Response
abstractions, and much more. 

I went ahead and wired the contact form's submission to a POST request sent
to the contacts API endpoint. I had to use AI to do so and admittedly cannot 
explain how some aspects of my solution actually work, but did succeed 
nonetheless. I also took the initiative by using bcrypt to handle password
hashing and salting for me because bcrypt is apparently standard in the 
industry. I also went above and beyond by restricting many API endpoints 
to administators only and validating email and phone number inputs with 
regular expressions.

I am beginning to see the immense power of web application development using
these four technologies. Creating complex web applications is significantly 
easier if one is familiar with MEAN or MERN development. I plan on further
improving my work by enforcing unique emails amongst users, refining my 
regular expressions even further, and polishing other subtle details. 

I have submitted my work without node modules for the ease of file transfer.
