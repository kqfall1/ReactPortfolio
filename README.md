I have broadened my understanding of MERN development in this phase of the 
portfolio project. I have a stronger grasp on how Node and Express work, 
which I found to be the most perplexing part of my college course so far. 

I now see the true power and convenience of these technologies. Being able to
render components dynamically based on a user's authentication status is 
incredibly convenient. Furthermore, the RESTful APIs that drive MongoDB are 
brilliant. It's not hard to imagine how much time these technologies have 
saved development teams since their inceptions. 

Although I believe I have largely fulfilled the requirements of this 
assignment, I still am left with a lingering dissatisfaction with my work. I 
believe that I am beginning to truly think like a software engineer, which 
unfortunately means being hyper aware of programming flaws, no matter how 
subtle. I just try to remind myself that perfect software doesn't exist! 
Perhaps perfect execution does, though.
