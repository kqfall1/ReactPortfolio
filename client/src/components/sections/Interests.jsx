            Hello there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio. I am a 23-year-old student at Centennial College 
            studying Software Engineering Technology. Not only have I always been good at coding, but I have 
            always enjoyed it. It was one of the few subjects in high school I didn't feel challenged by and
            always looked foward to. However, I put off pursuing it as a career for far too long. I'm glad
            that I'm finally living the life that I was meant to live.<br/><br/>
                
            When I'm not coding or studying, I may be working out. I try to stay active and healthy, 
            especially with the sedentary lifestyle that comes with coding often. I try to read books 
            regularly, though I go through phases where I read often and then not at all. I also enjoy 
            watching football, hockey, and baseball, though I've never competed in any of those sports 
            myself. I was pretty good at Muay Thai kickboxing when I was younger, believe it or not! I wish 
            to get back into training Muay Thai when I have the time. <br/><br/>
            
            Whether I’m training, reading, or coding, I’m always looking for ways to grow — and I bring 
            that same mindset to every project I work on.
